# covid-daily-questions
A web page that can ask users a daily questionnaire and share the status as a clear indicator on a daily basis.

Background:
---
In some situations, users may need to answer a set of questions to indicate they are not showing Covid-19 symptoms. This question and answer process can take time to complete, extending bottlenecks, delays and resulting in increased groups.

Solution:
---
Users can complete the questionnaire at home, and show via a simple status page that they have answered these questions each day. The result will be clear from a distance along with the date to ensure recency of results.
Users are discouraged from blindly answering questions by random ordering and alternate versions of questions.
